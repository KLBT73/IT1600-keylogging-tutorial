# Overview
My name is Kyle Bennett and I'm a student studying Information Technology at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I have created this tutorial for my INFOTC 1600 course. Inside this tutorial, I aim to familiarize readers with what exactly a keylogger is, how they can be used, how someone can detect a keylogger, and how one can prevent themselves from being exposed to keyloggers. I aim to make this as informative and helpful as possible so readers can have some sort of take-away. 

The table of contents below can be used to navigate to each section. On each individual page a navigation/go-to menu will be displayed for easy navigation.
