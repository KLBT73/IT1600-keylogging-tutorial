# Overview
My name is <b>Kyle Bennett</b> and I'm a student studying Information Technology at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I have created this tutorial for my INFOTC 1600 course. Inside this tutorial, I aim to familiarize readers with what exactly a keylogger is, how they can be used, how someone can detect a keylogger, and how one can prevent themselves from being exposed to keyloggers. I aim to make this as informative and helpful as possible so readers can have some sort of take-away. 

The target audience is anyone who possesses an interest in Information Technology, finds the use of keyloggers fascinating, or anyone who likes to learn about a topic they're not familiar with.

The table of contents below can be used to navigate to each section. On each individual page a navigation/go-to menu will be displayed for easy navigation. 

# History
The use of keyloggers pre-dates personal computers we see today, all the way back to [early 1970s.](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2003395-what-is-keylogging-definition-history-and-how-to-detect-word-of-the-week#:~:text=Keylogging%20predates%20the%20era%20of,the%20keystrokes%20via%20radio%20frequency) It's stated that Russian spies had bugged US diplomats' typewriters. The strokes were then recorded and trasnmitted over radio frequencies. As technology updated, keyloggers became more complex and universal. We still have hardware keyloggers today, but now a keylogger can be stored in a script or in a piece of software. Keyloggers can be masked as fake excel, word, or even pdf documents to fool an unsuspecting victim. It was also found that some sites that host cracked versions of software or even videogames can be plagued with malicious links that contain a keylogger.
