# History
The use of keyloggers pre-dates personal computers we see today, all the way back to [early 1970s.](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2003395-what-is-keylogging-definition-history-and-how-to-detect-word-of-the-week#:~:text=Keylogging%20predates%20the%20era%20of,the%20keystrokes%20via%20radio%20frequency) It's stated that Russian spies had bugged US diplomats' typewriters. The strokes were then recorded and trasnmitted over radio frequencies. As technology updated, keyloggers became more complex and universal. We still have hardware keyloggers today, but now a keylogger can be stored in a script or in a piece of software. Keyloggers can be masked as fake excel, word, or even pdf documents to fool an unsuspecting victim. It was also found that some sites that host cracked versions of software or even videogames can be plagued with malicious links that contain a keylogger.
